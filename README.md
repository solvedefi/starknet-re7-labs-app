3. Concentrated Liquidity Impermanent calculator ðŸš§
4. One click $STRK claim for DeFi spring users ðŸš§

## Project structure
The project is build using NextJS and Typescript. Below is the broad project structure:  
1. Re-usable project wide components go into `src/components`. Page specific components go into their respective folder. (e.g. `src/app/claims/components`)
2. We use [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) for state management. Atoms are written in `src/store`. E.g. `src/store/strategies.atoms.ts`.
   Most re-usable data is written into atoms, outside components so that data is eaily accessible across components without dumping custom logic into components.
   Its suggested to keep view components low on business logic code.
3. All protocols have a class object (e.g. `src/store/ekubo.store.ts`). Where protocol specific custom logic is written, so that its get written to respective Atoms.
4. You can use `src/store/IDapp.store.ts` to define abstract class or type definitions that can be used within protocol class objects.
5. Custom re-usable hooks are written to `src/hooks`.
